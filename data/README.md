# ItgDB
The following link contains the files of taxonomy-based ITGDB and sequence-based ITGDB. Each ITGDB has two files - sequence file and taxonomy file:

Taxonomy-based ITGDB: ```taxa_itgdb_seq.fasta``` (sequence file) and ```taxa_itgdb_taxa.txt``` (taxonomy file)\
Sequence-based ITGDB: ```seq_itgdb_seq.fasta``` (sequence file) and ```seq_itgdb_taxa.txt``` (taxonomy file)

To be compatible with the SINTAX classifier, ```seq_itgdb.udb``` and ```taxa_itgdb.udb``` are provided.\
To run with the SPINGO classifier, ```taxa_itgdb_spingo.fa``` is provided.\
There are three trained QIIME2 classifiers, named as ```taxa_itgdb_q2_2020_08_clf.qza```, ```taxa_itgdb_q2_2021_08_clf.qza```, and ```taxa_itgdb_q2_2022_11_clf.qza```, which are trained to be compatible with QIIME2 version 2020, 2021, and 2022, repectively.
