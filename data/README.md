# ItgDB
The following link contains the files of taxonomy-based ITGDB and sequence-based ITGDB. Each ITGDB has two files - sequence file and taxonomy file:

Taxonomy-based ITGDB: ```taxa_itgdb_seq.fasta``` (sequence file) and ```taxa_itgdb_taxa.txt``` (taxonomy file)\
Sequence-based ITGDB: ```seq_itgdb_seq.fasta``` (sequence file) and ```seq_itgdb_taxa.txt``` (taxonomy file)

To be compatible with the SINTAX classifier, ```seq_itgdb.udb``` and ```taxa_itgdb.udb``` are provided.
To run with the SPINGO classifier, ```taxa_itgdb_spingo.fa``` is provided.
The trained QIIME2 classifier artifact is provided as ```taxa_itgdb_qiime2.qza```.
